### Introduction to Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This course is part of multiple programs. 

What you'll learn
Describe the Web Application Development Ecosystem and terminology like front-end developer, back-end, server-side, and full stack.

Identify the developer tools and integrated development environments (IDEs) used by web developers. 

Create and structure basic web pages using HTML and style them with CSS. 

Develop dynamic web pages with interactive features using JavaScript. 

The project for this course is to create a simple web page / portfolio page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

### Since I already have a [Portfolio page](crod.co/portfolio), I decided to create a simple portfolio for the character Bender from the TV show Futurama.

I have included the files for the project in this repo.
